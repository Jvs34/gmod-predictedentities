gmod-predictedentities
======================

An entity base that you can use to create any sort of player usable addon, such as a jetpack, a shoulder strapped rocket launcher ( and more ) that can also function normally in the world.

It has support for custom keybindings and right click editing.

I think of this entity base as complete, I can't really think of any other features to implement without bloating it ( already learned from that mistake ).

However, feel free to leave an issue to have something implemented or even a pull request.

======================

Head over to the wiki for a small tutorial on how to create one.

======================

I'll try to make something to auto generate documentation for functions for the wiki, but the documentation right now is good enough.
